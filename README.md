# Save_the_Bees

This is an analysis from the Save the Bees dataset.

Our analysis led us to a conclusive determination that the primary factor contributing to colony destruction is the presence of the Varroa mite. Furthermore, our findings pinpoint Kansas as the state experiencing the most significant losses in honeybee colonies. This insight underscores the urgency of addressing Varroa mite infestations as a crucial step in mitigating colony losses, especially in regions such as Kansas where the impact appears to be particularly pronounced.
This is most relevant result for this problem. Lots of data can be analized for other puroposes.
